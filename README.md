# Facial Expression Recognition Challenge

## Overview

This project tackles the Facial Expression Recognition Challenge from Kaggle, where the goal is to classify facial expressions from grayscale images into seven categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral.

The dataset contains 48Ã—48 pixel grayscale facial images with corresponding emotion labels. This challenge tests the ability of machine learning models to recognize human emotions from visual data.

## Dataset

- Training set: 28,709 examples
- Public test set: 3,589 examples
- Private test set: 3,589 examples

## Evaluation

Models are evaluated based on their accuracy in predicting the correct emotion class for each image.
